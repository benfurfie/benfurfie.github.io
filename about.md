Hi. I'm Ben. I've been developing websites since 2002. After a ten year stint in journalism, I decided to follow my passion and become a full time front end developer.

Since then, I've built websites using a variety of content management systems, including Drupal, WordPress, Magento, Perch, Statamic and Jekyll (which powers this very blog).

I love helping other developers – especially those running their own freelance businesses (been there, done that, got the grey hairs).

## About this blog
I started this blog to provide me with somewhere to put my thoughts about front end development and the business of web development.

## Mentoring
If you're based around the Liverpool area, I offer one-to-one mentoring. At the beginning, I'll help you learn the basics – such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'll also give you projects and tasks to make use of your new knowledge.

It's £20 a week* and is offered in the evenings and on weekends. It usually takes between six and 12 months – depending on the time you put in. That's just over £500 to learn to become a web developer.

Once you've gotten to a point where you can start applying for junior front end developer positions, you can either stop paying or continue paying £20 a month to be able to ask me questions and for feedback on code. For more information, drop me an email hello[at]benfurfie.co.uk.

_* Additional software including a subscription to Treehouse will be required._

## Podcasting
In 2015, I hosted a fortnightly podcast called UK Genesis, which was aimed at promoting web developers in the UK that use the Genesis Framework for WordPress.

I have also appeared on several podcasts, including:

* [Office Hours FM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6O7BOAF4o) - Freelance gone corporate –  I spoke about deciding to take a full time job.
* [Art of Value](http://artofvalue.com/the-real-goal-of-value-pricing/) - The real goal of value pricing – I spoke about why I adopted value pricing and how I implemented within my business.  

If you want me to appear on your podcast, drop me an email hello[at]benfurfie.co.uk with what you'd like to talk about and when you'd need me to be free. If I can do it, I'll be more than happy to appear on your show.

## Speaking
* WordCamp Birmingham - Designers: How to stop your developer from wanting to kill you.
* [WordCamp London](http://wordpress.tv/2015/06/02/ben-furfie-how-to-value-price-websites/) – How to value price websites.

If you want me to speak at your event, drop me an email hello[at]benfurfie.co.uk with details about your event and the topic you would like me to talk about. Please note: If you are charging more than £100/$150 a ticket, I will expect you to cover my expenses (travel and accomodation) at a minimum.
