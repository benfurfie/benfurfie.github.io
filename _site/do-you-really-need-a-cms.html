            <h1>Do you really need a CMS?</h1>

            <p>Check any blog post on what you must have in your next website and a CMS is a likely to be near the top.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-cms">What is a CMS?</h2>
<p>A CMS – or content management system – is a way for you (or your web designer/developer) to quickly and dynamically update the content on your website without needing to dive into code. The opposite of a dynamic website is a static website.</p>

<p>The most popular CMS around is WordPress, though there are many more options. Some other popular CMSs include Drupal, Expression Engine and Magento. There are also a raft of CMSs which are gaining popularity, such as Perch, Statamic, Craft and Jekyll.</p>

<p>They are also possibly one of the most requested features of a new website. But do you actually need one? Well, no, you don’t.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-you-think-you-need-a-cms">Why do you think you need a CMS?</h2>
<p>When investing in a website, chances are you will want to get the biggest bang for your buck possible. Many agencies and freelancers – just like car salesmen – will convince you that you need to buy bigger and better; and preferably with the most options they can bundle in. Want to be able to edit your website? Sure thing!</p>

<p>A quick Google search turns up tens of thousands of blog posts of why you simply must have a CMS. The thing is, they’re all lies. They’re little more than a sales tactic to get you to spend more money.</p>

<p>Like that rear mounted bike rack and roof storage box a car salesman will try to seell you, chances are you’re never going to use a CMS – no matter how much you convince yourself you will at the time. In fact, they’ll simply slow you down and increase your expenses.</p>

<p>In the case of the car accessories, they’ll increase the fuel you use. As for your website, a CMS will increase the amount of hosting resources you need, which means more money every month you’re spending on something you don’t use.</p>

<p>And in the case of editing content on your website – chances are – it will be cheaper (not to mention easier) to have a monthly agreement with your web designer or developer for them to update the content for you.</p>

<h2 id="reality-cmss-are-often-an-expensive-waste-of-money-you-wont-use">Reality: CMSs are often an expensive waste of money you won’t use</h2>
<p>If you run a small business, chances are you won’t have time to spend editing your site – no matter how much you convince yourself. I’ve seen it time and time again; small businesses spending money they can ill-waste on a website with a CMS that they never end up using. The same goes for blogs.</p>

<p>The company I work for during the day has nearly 20,000 small business customers on static sites. On a busy week, we might have ten email us or call us to change content on their sites – usually just a phone number, email address or their location. Chances are, you’ll find you have the same needs.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-alternative">What is the alternative?</h2>
<p>A static website is increasingly becoming the best and most cost effective type of website for small businesses. They are low maintenance, almost unhackable compared to CMS-based websites and most importantly in today’s world of SEO, they’re lightening fast.</p>

<p>In fact, there is nothing new about static websites. The first websites were static. Indeed, up until the turn of the millenium, most websites were static.</p>

<p>It may even surprise you to learn this website is a static – even though it has a blog. The reality is that CMSs are a waste of money for most businesses. Unless your business relies on generating content (such as a newspaper, blog or ecommerce website) chances are you’ll be able to get a far better return on your investment with a static website.</p>

<p>So next time you go to invest in a website, consider going static.</p>
