Check any blog post on what you must have in your next website and a CMS is a likely to be near the top.

## What is a CMS?
A CMS – or content management system – is a way for you (or your web designer/developer) to quickly and dynamically update the content on your website without needing to dive into code. The opposite of a dynamic website is a static website.

The most popular CMS around is WordPress, though there are many more options. Some other popular CMSs include Drupal, Expression Engine and Magento. There are also a raft of CMSs which are gaining popularity, such as Perch, Statamic, Craft and Jekyll.

They are also possibly one of the most requested features of a new website. But do you actually need one? Well, no, you don't.

## Why do you think you need a CMS?
When investing in a website, chances are you will want to get the biggest bang for your buck possible. Many agencies and freelancers – just like car salesmen – will convince you that you need to buy bigger and better; and preferably with the most options they can bundle in. Want to be able to edit your website? Sure thing!

A quick Google search turns up tens of thousands of blog posts of why you simply must have a CMS. The thing is, they're all lies. They're little more than a sales tactic to get you to spend more money.

Like that rear mounted bike rack and roof storage box a car salesman will try to seell you, chances are you're never going to use a CMS – no matter how much you convince yourself you will at the time. In fact, they'll simply slow you down and increase your expenses.

In the case of the car accessories, they'll increase the fuel you use. As for your website, a CMS will increase the amount of hosting resources you need, which means more money every month you're spending on something you don't use.

And in the case of editing content on your website – chances are – it will be cheaper (not to mention easier) to have a monthly agreement with your web designer or developer for them to update the content for you.

## Reality: CMSs are often an expensive waste of money you won't use
If you run a small business, chances are you won't have time to spend editing your site – no matter how much you convince yourself. I've seen it time and time again; small businesses spending money they can ill-waste on a website with a CMS that they never end up using. The same goes for blogs.

The company I work for during the day has nearly 20,000 small business customers on static sites. On a busy week, we might have ten email us or call us to change content on their sites – usually just a phone number, email address or their location. Chances are, you'll find you have the same needs.

## What is the alternative?
A static website is increasingly becoming the best and most cost effective type of website for small businesses. They are low maintenance, almost unhackable compared to CMS-based websites and most importantly in today's world of SEO, they're lightening fast.

In fact, there is nothing new about static websites. The first websites were static. Indeed, up until the turn of the millenium, most websites were static.

It may even surprise you to learn this website is a static – even though it has a blog. The reality is that CMSs are a waste of money for most businesses. Unless your business relies on generating content (such as a newspaper, blog or ecommerce website) chances are you'll be able to get a far better return on your investment with a static website.

So next time you go to invest in a website, consider going static.
