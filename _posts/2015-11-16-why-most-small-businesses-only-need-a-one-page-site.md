It's fairly common for small businesses to think they need an all singing, all dancing website.

Most only need a single page for all their informational content.

You could then attach a blog which could focus on:  

* Customer wins
* Finishing off a project
* New hires
* Answering frequently asked questions

And so on...

Don't even need to be able to edit the site beyond contact details. No need for CMS. Can even be static.
